<h4>Introduction</h4>

The Corps of Discovery Online Atlas is a digital map of the historic route of the Lewis & Clark Expedition. This atlas builds on the considerable past work of mapping the expedition both in digital and analog environments. The resource is intended to harness current web technology to help anyone studying the expedition to understand its physical trajectory and identify the locations of major events along the way. It is also intended as an easy to use reference for students learning about the history of the expedition as well as a handy tool for general readers with interest in the topic.

The atlas includes the inbound and outbound routes of the expedition as well as locations and descriptions of major waypoints along the route. Bibliographic references are provided for further reading about each waypoint. Additional map layers provide further context including American Indian Tribal regions, an 1803 political map, and a map of biomes,

Initiated in the fall of 2017, the project was developed by Lewis & Clark College History and Computer Science majors with guidance from staff at Watzek Library.
