export const about = "Lewis and Clark Collegeâ€™s Watzek Library is in the process of creating an online map of the Lewis & Clark Expedition. \
The map will be accessible and provide authoritative geographic reference to the pathways and waypoints of the Lewis & Clark Expedition using current web mapping technology. \
The map will draw on the significant collections of literature on the Lewis and Clark Expedition that Watzek Library holds. \
The map is intended to help anyone studying the expedition understand its physical trajectory and identify the locations of major events along the way. \
It is also intended as an easy to use reference for students learning about the history of the expedition, as well as a handy tool for general readers with interest in the topic.  \
The focus will be on the history of the expedition rather than contemporary waypoints and monuments that commemorate the expedition.";
